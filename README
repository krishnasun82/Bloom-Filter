Bloom filter code expanded over the recipe posted by Raymond Hettinger in ActiveState site: http://bit.ly/bloom_filter.

It requires the number of bits, number of probes, and a yielding hash function as shown in my fork of the recipe: http://bit.ly/kN3Q2w. (reproduced here for convenience)

def get_probes(bfilter, key):
    hasher = Random(key).randrange
    for _ in range(bfilter.num_probes):
        array_index = hasher(len(bfilter.arr))
        bit_index = hasher(32)
        yield array_index, 1 << bit_index
